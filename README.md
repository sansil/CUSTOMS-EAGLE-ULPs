If you are soldering your components manually this ULP will help you.
Highlight all the components with the same value on the board.

## change_att_value

Change the all values with the "MPN" attribute .
Helpful for example when you need to change the MPN (manufacturer part number) of one component for a new one (out of stock for example).
